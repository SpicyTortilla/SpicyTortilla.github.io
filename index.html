				<p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio</p>
				<p>Growing up in the central valley has had its ups and downs.  For a long time I wondered what I wanted to become?  What my carrer would be?  After some time of not thinking about it and just focusing on graduating at my highschool, I signed up for a web design because it seemed interesting.  It turned out to be one of the greatest expirences in a class I've ever spent!  I had a amazing teacher who explained everything without making it complicated.  He made sure everyone understood the what he was teaching us.  The class had lots to challenge me on and had opportunity for creativity.  It was fun to work on assignments and to hang out with the people around me.  I always looked foward to "Work Days" as he called it, where we would not learn anything new but just foucus all on our work, relaxing really.</p>
